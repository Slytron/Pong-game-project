# Pong-game-project

This pong game was made as a a part of Angela Yu's - 100 days of code, on Udemy.

The premise is quite simple.

The game has 4 parts:
- Main - This is your basis of the game, it handles the combinations of the other 3 parts, and makes the game function. Also it functions as the game engine, using Turtle module for python.
- Paddle - Creates the 2 vertical moving paddles, for 2 players.
- Ball - Creates a ball in the middle of the screen, also makes it move and bounce when hitting walls/paddles. There is a slight movespeed modifier, that speeds it up each time it hits something.
- Scoreboard - As the name suggest, it keeps count of each time a player scores. First to 100 wins.

Considering some Turtle module bugs, I would suggest that each person modifies the ball movespeed according to their wishes.
